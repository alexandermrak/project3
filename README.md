# Trip Planner
Want to plan a vacation but don't know the exact date? Say you want to go to Europe but you only know a general time you will visit, like late 2021. The Trip Planner is just the app for you! With this app you can sign up/log in and create trip plans which can specify the location, general date, length of stay, and any notes/activites you want to do. 

# Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, React, & Node

# Next Steps
I plan on consuming a 3rd party API for the location, as well as add user experience features(such as a warning before you delete a trip, and better CSS styling)
